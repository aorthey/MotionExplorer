[ ] Fix contact point while interpolation (so that it does not slide)
[ ] Visualize path for every contact


Connecting two states on the same mode, but with different fixed constraints
results in the second state being projected onto the first, and then
interpolated and an edge is created

Solution: check if fixed constraints are compatible. (in reach?)
