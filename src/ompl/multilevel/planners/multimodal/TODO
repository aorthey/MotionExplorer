[x] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer (make corresponding changes in GUI)
[x] Anytime thread-based (plus exhaustive mode)
[x] Every non-const function of LMT should be mutexed

[ ] Make sure that pdef->getGoal/getObjective is as quick as setting them
beforehand
[ ] Fix goal regions
[ ] Relax assumption that optimizer always converges (idempotent).
[ ] Better visualization of path classes (beginning with bold green, rest with
magenta or red?) [Should be addressed by blender]
[ ] Pipe it all to blender [Export scene to dae. Export frames (world pos) to txt. Import to
blender.]. Make an automatic "render image" from current camera view by invoking
bpy script! Could also be used to handle partial path displays.
[ ] More experiments:
  [ ] Hand scenario baxter
  [ ] Overtaking in time
  

[ ] Rename BasePathHead -> Head
[ ] Rename FindSEctionAnalyzer -> HeadAnalyzer
