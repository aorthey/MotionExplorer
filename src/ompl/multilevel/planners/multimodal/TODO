MOST PRESSING ISSUES:

(1) What to do about non-converged minima?
(2) Fix multilevel assignment of minima to classes

Colorscheme: Env in light gray. Robot start in dark grey. Paths in light blue.
Goal position in dark blue. 
Configuration spaces in light grey (to have similarity to env). Paths there also
in light blue, goal pos in dark blue. 
Paths could also be gradient of color (to showcase in which direction the path
goes!). Then we would color code robot as light blue, end pos as dark(er) blue?

---- Theory/Algorithmic Tasks

[ ] How to address minima which have not yet been converged (example:
03D_rod.xml). Ideas are either to do additional sweeps over database to update
minima over time. Or use visibility checker? Or do nothing: argue that this is a
problem of the OPTIMIZER. Our job is only to detect it and point it out.

[ ] Relax assumption that optimizer always converges (idempotent).

[ ] Implement the three different modes (call them differently. Extension
strategy maybe)

[ ] Fix assignment of edges in LMT. We should make sure that they belong to the
correct minimum.

Sparse roadmap->Generate Candidates->Optimize->Add to Database
(1) Allocate time budget to optimize database (and compare paths)

---- Pipeline Tasks

[ ] Implement multi-goal regions
  [x] Allow specification in XML (first do multiple states)
  [ ] Allow goal-space-region specification

[ ] Get rid of dynamics. Would be nice, but makes it too complicated to
understand. Better have that as a separate contribution.

[ ] Pipe it all to blender 
  [x] Export scene to dae. 
  [ ] Export frames (world pos) to txt. 
  [ ] Import to blender using bpy.
  [ ] Make an automatic "render image" from current camera view by invoking
      bpy script! Could also be used to handle partial paths.

[ ] Find better name for PathSpaceSparse. TreeBuilder. MultimodalExplorer.
MultimodalBuilder. LocalMinimaSpanner. MultiPath.

Multimodal Sparse Roadmap (MULTISPARO)

Rapidly-exploring random-tree (RRT) algorithm

[ ] Interesting >3dof experiments (try to come up with examples which visualize
different symbols)
  [ ] Left/Right: Mobile Base
  [ ] Up/Down: Drone
  [ ] CW/CCW: Revolute joints/Manipulators
  [ ] Hand scenario baxter (Combination)
  [ ] Overtaking in time
  [ ] Different robots to combine Left/Right, Up/Down, CW/CCW
  [ ] Different grasping positions! Requires goal states
  [ ] Scenario where multiple goal regions are important. Touch table? Subspace
goal regions! 2D scenario: escape cube? Minima are direct connections from
center to faces.

---- Finished Tasks
[x] Rename BasePathHead -> Head
[x] Rename FindSEctionAnalyzer -> HeadAnalyzer
[x] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer (make corresponding changes in GUI)
[x] Anytime thread-based (plus exhaustive mode)
[x] Every non-const function of LMT should be mutexed
[x] Fix Mobius State Space (interpolation seems off. Do 3d interpolation+projection)
