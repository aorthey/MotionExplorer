[ ] How to address minima which have not yet been converged (example:
03D_rod.xml). Ideas are either to do additional sweeps over database to update
minima over time. Or use visibility checker? Or do nothing: argue that this is a
problem of the OPTIMIZER. Our job is only to detect it and point it out.
[ ] Relax assumption that optimizer always converges (idempotent).

[ ] Fix Mobius State Space (interpolation seems off. Do 3d interpolation+projection)
[ ] Implement multi-goal regions

[ ] Find better name for PathSpaceSparse. TreeBuilder. MultimodalExplorer.
MultimodalBuilder. LocalMinimaSpanner. MultiPath.

[ ] Make sure that pdef->getGoal/getObjective is as quick as setting them
beforehand

[ ] Pipe it all to blender [Export scene to dae. Export frames (world pos) to txt. Import to
blender.]. Make an automatic "render image" from current camera view by invoking
bpy script! Could also be used to handle partial path displays.

[ ] Interesting experiments (try to come up with examples which visualize
different symbols)
  [ ] Left/Right: Mobile Base
  [ ] Up/Down: Drone
  [ ] CW/CCW: Revolute joints
  [ ] Hand scenario baxter
  [ ] Overtaking in time

[x] Rename BasePathHead -> Head
[x] Rename FindSEctionAnalyzer -> HeadAnalyzer
[x] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer (make corresponding changes in GUI)
[x] Anytime thread-based (plus exhaustive mode)
[x] Every non-const function of LMT should be mutexed
