[ ] Make sure that we always are cost non-increasing

MOST PRESSING ISSUES:

[ ] Implement the three different modes (call them differently. Extension
strategy maybe)

[ ] Fix assignment of edges in LMT. We should make sure that they belong to the
correct minimum.

Sparse roadmap->Generate Candidates->Optimize->Add to Database
(1) Allocate time budget to optimize database (and compare paths)

---- Pipeline Tasks

[ ] Implement multi-goal regions
  [x] Allow specification in XML (first do multiple states)
  [ ] Allow goal-space-region specification

[ ] Get rid of dynamics. Would be nice, but makes it too complicated to
understand. Better have that as a separate contribution.

[ ] Pipe it all to blender 
  [x] Export scene to dae. 
  [ ] Export frames (world pos) to txt. 
  [ ] Import to blender using bpy.
  [ ] Make an automatic "render image" from current camera view by invoking
      bpy script! Could also be used to handle partial paths.


[ ] Interesting >3dof experiments (try to come up with examples which visualize
different symbols)
  [ ] Left/Right: Mobile Base
  [ ] Up/Down: Drone
  [ ] CW/CCW: Revolute joints/Manipulators
  [ ] Hand scenario baxter (Combination)
  [ ] Overtaking in time
  [ ] Different robots to combine Left/Right, Up/Down, CW/CCW
  [ ] Different grasping positions! Requires goal states
  [ ] Scenario where multiple goal regions are important. Touch table? Subspace
goal regions! 2D scenario: escape cube? Minima are direct connections from
center to faces.

---- Finished Tasks
[x] Rename BasePathHead -> Head
[x] Rename FindSEctionAnalyzer -> HeadAnalyzer
[x] Add function getLocalMinimaTree() to explorer (make corresponding changes in GUI)
[x] Anytime thread-based (plus exhaustive mode)
[x] Every non-const function of LMT should be mutexed
[x] Fix Mobius State Space (interpolation seems off. Do 3d interpolation+projection)
[x] Relax assumption that optimizer always converges (idempotent).
[x] Find better name for PathSpaceSparse. TreeBuilder. MultimodalExplorer.
MultimodalBuilder. LocalMinimaSpanner. MultiPath.
