#Experiments

* Periodic motions in maze (moving maze on torus or sphere?)
* Closing door

* Overtaking of car on road with several moving participants

* Mobile Manipulator (7-dof plus time)
** Mobile manipulator with bat trying to catch a ball (sampleable goal region,
  but only tiny portion is feasible. Finding that is biggest problem)
** Picking from conveyor belt (time/goal can be sampled)

#Problems
* How to efficiently sample goal region? Especially if there exists only a
  single time instance at which we can solve the problem. Maybe first
sample/solve this problem? Multi-arm bandit problem over goal regions?
